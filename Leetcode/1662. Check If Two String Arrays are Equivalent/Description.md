Given: Two string arrays word1 and word2
Return: True if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

Example:

Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.
